# Test Plan for CrtaftMyPortfolio

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this test plan is to ensure the quality and reliability of the CrtaftMyPortfolio, a React.js web application, through comprehensive testing.

### 1.2 Scope
The testing will cover critical components, features, and user flows of the application, including the interaction with external dependencies like Firebase.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Verify the functionality of React components and their interactions.
- Ensure the application's compatibility with different browsers and devices.
- Validate the integration with Firebase for data management and authentication.
- Identify and fix defects to improve the overall application quality.

## 2. Testing Approach

### 2.1 Automated Testing
- Utilize Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests and component testing.
- Test the interactions with Firebase using appropriate Firebase testing libraries (if available).

### 2.2 Manual Testing
- Conduct exploratory testing to identify usability and UX issues.
- Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with real users or stakeholders to validate the application's usability.

## 3. Test Environments

### 3.1 Development Environment
- Browsers: Chrome
- Devices: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile

### 3.2 Staging Environment
- Browsers: Chrome
- Devices: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile

## 4. Test Cases

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- Test individual React components to ensure they render correctly and handle different scenarios.
- Validate component behavior based on input props and state changes.

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- Test interactions between React components and external dependencies like Firebase.
- Verify data flow and state management across components.

### 4.3 Functional Testing
- Validate key features and user flows, such as user registration, login, data submission, and user profile editing.
- Test application responsiveness and layout across different screen sizes.

### 4.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Engage real users or stakeholders to perform UAT and gather feedback on application usability and user experience.

## 5. Test Data

### 5.1 Test Data Preparation
- Prepare representative test data for different test scenarios, covering positive and negative cases.
- Ensure test data complies with data privacy regulations and does not interfere with the production database.

## 6. Bug Tracking and Reporting

### 6.1 Bug Tracking Tool
- Use a bug tracking tool (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) to report and manage identified issues during testing.

## 7. Test Execution

### 7.1 Test Execution Schedule
- Define a timeline for test execution and communicate it with the testing team.

### 7.2 Test Progress Monitoring
- Regularly monitor and report the progress of testing activities.

## 8. Test Completion Criteria

### 8.1 Exit Criteria
Testing can be considered complete when:
- Critical defects are addressed, and the application meets the acceptance criteria.
- Code coverage reaches the defined target (e.g., 80%).

## 9. Risks and Contingencies

### 9.1 Identify Risks
- List potential risks related to the testing process and application.

### 9.2 Contingency Plans
- Outline plans to address identified risks and minimize their impact on testing.

## 10. Review and Approval

### 10.1 Review
- The test plan will be reviewed by the project team and stakeholders to gather feedback and suggestions.

### 10.2 Approval
- The test plan requires approval from the project manager or stakeholders before test execution.

## 11. Summary

Provide a concise summary of the test plan, highlighting its key objectives and testing approach.
